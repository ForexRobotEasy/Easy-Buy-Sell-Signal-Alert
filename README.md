# Easy Buy Sell Signal Alert

This code is a sample implementation of a trading algorithm that generates buy and sell signals based on the trend of a given trading symbol. The algorithm uses the `Trend` indicator from the MQL5 Technical library to analyze market data and determine the current trend. It then executes trades using the `Trade` library.

## Features

- Analyzes market data and generates buy and sell signals based on the trend indicator.
- Executes trades with a specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.
- Handles real-time alerts and notifications for newly generated signals.
- Closes trades automatically if the take profit or stop loss levels are reached.

## How It Works

1. The `AnalyzeMarketData()` function performs technical analysis using the `Trend` indicator to determine the current trend value.
2. If the trend value is positive, indicating a bullish trend, a buy signal is generated using the `trade.Buy()` function. The trade is executed with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.
3. If the trend value is negative, indicating a bearish trend, a sell signal is generated using the `trade.Sell()` function. The trade is executed with the specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.
4. The `ExecuteTrades()` function checks for pending buy and sell trades and closes them if the take profit or stop loss levels are reached.
5. The `HandleAlerts()` function checks for newly generated signals and sends email notifications and displays alerts on the chart.
6. The `OnTick()` function is the main program loop that calls the `AnalyzeMarketData()`, `ExecuteTrades()`, and `HandleAlerts()` functions on every tick.
7. The `OnInit()` function initializes the `trade` and `trend` objects with the required settings.
8. The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program is deinitialized and closes any open trades.
